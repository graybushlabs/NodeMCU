# Relay Module
This is a simple sketch that sets up a node server with a basic health check endpoint, and a web page to toggle the relay.

This uses a [Relay module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TKJ6XSM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) that is not just a relay on a board. There are LED's to indicate power and state and some protection stuff.
